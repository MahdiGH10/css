        <h1>About</h1>
        <p class="para1">Lee Sang-hyeok (Korean: 이상혁; born May 7, 1996), better known as Faker (Korean: 페이커), is a South Korean
            professional League of Legends player for T1. Formerly known as GoJeonPa (Korean: 고전파) on the Korean server,
            he was picked up by T1, then called SK Telecom T1, in 2013 and has played as the team's mid laner
            since.[2][3] He is widely considered to be the best League of Legends player of all time.[4]

            Lee is renowned for his high mechanical skill and extremely versatile champion pool. He is best known for
            playing LeBlanc, Zed, Syndra, Azir, Ahri, and Ryze.[5] He is the first player to have reached both 1,000 and
            2,000 kills in the LCK,[6] as well as first to have played 600 and 700 games and to have won 500 games.</p>
        <p class="para2">
            Lee is one of the only two players to have won the League of Legends World Championship three times, having
            done so in 2013, 2015 and 2016. He has also won the All-Star Paris 2014, the Mid-Season Invitational
            tournament in 2016 and 2017, and the IEM World Championship in 2016. He owns three different League of
            Legends skins as a result of winning World Championships, which include SKT T1 Zed (2013), SKT T1 Ryze
            (2015) and SKT T1 Syndra (2016).
            <br>
            Lee became a part owner of T1 Entertainment & Sports in early 2020.
